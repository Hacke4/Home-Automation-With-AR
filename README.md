⭐Hello this is Nikhilesh.


⭕This is the main moto or breief info of my project where i've used AR technology in Home automation.
Home automation using Augmented Reality (AR) involves using AR technology to control and manage various devices and systems in a home. This can include things like lighting, heating and cooling, security, and appliances.

⭕One way to use AR for home automation is through the use of an AR-enabled device, such as a smartphone or tablet. This device can be used to display virtual controls for different systems in the home, allowing the user to interact with and control them through gestures or voice commands. For example, the user can point their device at a light switch and use a virtual toggle to turn it on or off, or speak a command to control the thermostat.

⭕Another way to use AR for home automation is through the use of smart glasses or head-mounted displays. These devices can display virtual controls and information in the user's field of view, making them easily accessible and allowing the user to control various systems in the home without having to use a separate device.

✍Some examples of home automation using AR include:

〽️Controlling lights by pointing at the switch and using hand gestures or voice commands.

〽️Previewing how furniture would look in a room by using AR to superimpose virtual objects into the view of a smartphone or tablet camera.

〽️Using AR-enabled smart glasses to display notifications, temperature and other information and control the smart appliances in the home.

〽️In addition to making it more convenient for users to control and manage their home systems, home automation using AR also has the potential to improve energy efficiency by providing users with more detailed information about their energy usage and allowing them to make more informed decisions about how to reduce it.

Overall, Home automation using AR can make the process of controlling the home easy and interactive and the technology is still in development stage, therefore it's not yet widely adopted for home automation.

📌📌We havent developed it till the end.

I have contributed my work upto resources i've been working on.

For AR I have used [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html)  which helped me in making the work easier to me.
